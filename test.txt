ans 1. java 
       it is used to run the file in terminal with filename after compilation.
       ex java filename

       javac
       it is used to compile the source code.
       ex javac filename.java

ans 2. jdk
       java delevopment kit 
       it contains jvm and jre in it.

       JRE
       java Runtime Environment
       we have to set the java run time environment
       in c drive /programefiles /java /jdk and set the variable.

       JVM
       Java Virtual Machine 
       it is used to convert source code to byte code or machine language.

ans 3. .java file
       it cointains the source code in it and used to compile.

       .java class
       it is a raw file of the .java file.

ans 4. java IDE's are
       NetBeans
       Eclipes
       AndroidStudio
       
ans 5. a variable is a like container that stores the value or literal in it. 
       types.
       global variables these are accessible to every class in java
       static variable these can be accessible for static members only.
       local variables these are declared in the class and scope is within the class.
       constant variables these are used to aasing constant values so that it can't be changed.

       ex 
          int a=3;
          class ab{
          public static void main(String[] args){
         }
          }
        
          class abc{
          static int a=3;
          public static void main(String[] args){
          
          }
          }          
          
          class abcd{
          int a=3;
          public static void main(String[] args){
          }
          }
 
          class abcde{
          const a=3;
          public static void main(String[] args){
          }
          }

ans 6. OOP's in java 
       it is used to indicate real word objects in promming
       the main four pillars in OOPs in java are 
       Abstraction it will be present in every java class it is used to hide the implement.  
       Inheritance it will be present in every java class it is used extract parent class properties to child class there are types of inheritance multiple inheritance 
       multilevel inheritance,single inheritance, hirarical inheritance, hybrid inheritance.
       Polymorphism it will be present in every java class it means a function with different name with simailar functionalitise. types are compile time polimorphism 
       and run-time polymorphism. 
       Enclapsulation the process of hidding the implimentation and showing the implimentation to the user that are allowed to show.

ans 7. run 
 
ans 8. data types are used to store the value of similar types of data.
       ex Primite types
          int
          float
          double
          Long
          short
          byte
          boolean
          enum
          
          non primitive types
          array[]
          String
          class
          
         ex class abc{
            int a=3;
            float b=2.3;
            String name = "shivam";
            public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println(a);
            }
          }

ans 9. dot. operator is used to identify and call the reference type.
       ex class abc{
            static int a=3;
             abc{
             this.a=a;
                }
            public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println(a);
            }
          }
          

ans 10. java features are
        roburst and secure
        platform independent 
        high performance
        code reusability
 
ans 11. array is collection of similar type of data.
        ex  class abc{
            int[] a ={1,2,3,4,5};
            
            public static void main(String[], args){

          }
          }

ans 12. class is a blueprint of an object or a template.
        object is instance of a class that is used to represent real object by its behavior and properties.
         
        ex class Home{
            }
            class College{       
            public static void main(String[] args){
            Home home =new Home();       
            }
            }

ans 13. keywords are a special words that are used in programming.
        this
        int 
        float
        byte
        short
        boolean
        String
        for 
        while
        do
       ex class abc{
            static int a=3;
             abc{
             this.a=a;
                }
            public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println(a);
            }
          }

ans 14. constructor 
        it is a special method same name as class name
        its main purpose is to initial the object
        it does not have any return type
        it is non static
       type 
       parameterised construct it sends parameter in the constructor
       default constructor it is bydefault present in every java class which does't have any parameter

ans 15.
       main method is static because it is a main method and does't have any class or method in it
       types
       static methods are only acessible to static members only 
       non static method that are not static.

ans 16. 

                     class abc{
            static int[] a ={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};  
            static void arcount(){
			 System.out.println(a.length);	
			}			
            public static void main(String[] args){
         
           arcount();
           
  }

  }
    
ans 17. method 
          it is used to implement reusable code so that reusability can be achived.


        method overloading 
          it as a same name as a method but different parameters
 
       ex
        class abc
         {
         static String a="hello";
         static void hello(){
         System.out.println(a);
         } 
         static void hello(String a){
         System.out.println(a);
         }
         public static void main(String[] args){
         hello();
         hello("hi");
         }
       }
